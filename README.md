# MauiLoadTest

This sample .NET MAUI Telerik application demonstrates strategies to enhance the responsiveness of page navigation.

The destination page includes a CollectionView that populates with 12,345 records over a span of 3 to 6 seconds.

 - MainPage.xaml serves as the starter page.
 - WorsePage.xaml demonstrates a common, inefficient coding approach.
 - BestPage.xaml showcases best practices for improving responsiveness.
 - EmptyPage.xaml is included as a benchmark for comparison.
